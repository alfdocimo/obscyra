# Obscyra

"Obscyra" is a fast-paced survival action roguelite set in a corrupted realm where power comes at a cost.

You are a lone soul escaping a world drowning in crystalized corruption. Each wave of enemies brings chaos, and every fallen foe unleashes a curse that threatens to consume what’s left of you. As corruption builds within you, your strength grows — but so does the danger.

Wield devastating melee and ranged attacks. Harness your corruption to unlock brutal abilities, but tread carefully: overuse it, and it will break you.

Time your attacks. Manage your resources. Resist the pull of oblivion.

🩸 Features:
🧪 Corruption Mechanic: Power grows with corruption — until it breaks you.

⚔️ Dual Combat: Fluid ranged and melee combat with skill-switching and cooldowns.

🌀 Dynamic Particle Effects that visually evolve with your corruption state.

🧠 Skill-based Leveling: Unlock and equip new abilities as you level.

💥 Wave-Based Mayhem: Survive up to 30 deadly waves of escalating enemies.

🌌 Minimalist Lore: A haunting world where every moment matters — and everything is fading.

Don’t let the corruption take what’s left of you. Escape while you still remember who you are.

Can you survive until wave 30?
